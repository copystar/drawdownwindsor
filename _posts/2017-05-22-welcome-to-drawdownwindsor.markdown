[Drawdown](http://www.drawdown.org/) is a 2017 book edited by [Paul Hawken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hawken) that 'maps, measures, models, and describes the 100 most substantive solutions to global warming.'  

Drawdown Windsor is a blog by [Mita Williams](http://aedileworks.com/) that applies the recommendations of the book to Windsor, Ontario, Canada.   

Check out [Repair The World][repairtheworld] which is a monthly meetup hosted at [Hackforge](http://hackf.org/) for related events and community activities.
