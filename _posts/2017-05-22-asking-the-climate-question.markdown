> ... the City also needs to develop on-going strategies that will continue to address the changing climate over the long-term. The 
following strategies should be undertaken to ensure that the City of Windsor continues to be a leader on adaptation well into the future:
1. Incorporate climate change adaptation into city policies and high level plans;
2. **Create internal mechanisms to ‘ask the climate question’ for all new major infrastructure 
projects**;
3. Monitor climate change, evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and adjust as 
needed (adaptive management);
4. Use best available science to analyze how the climate is changing locally and how this may 
impact the community;
5. Routinely review the City of Windsor’s vulnerability to climate change;
6. Continuously conduct risk assessments to identify priority impacts requiring adaptation actions, 
7. Engage the public, business and other stakeholder groups.  

From the [2012 City of Windsor Climate Change Adaption Plan (PDF)](http://www.citywindsor.ca/residents/environment/environmental-master-plan/documents/windsor%20climate%20change%20adaptation%20plan.pdf)

Can city councillors ask whether 'the climate question' was addressed when new major infrastructure is reported on in council?
